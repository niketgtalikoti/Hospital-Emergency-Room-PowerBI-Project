# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involves designing an interactive and insightful Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize data from a hospital's emergency room. The dataset covers patient statistics over a period of 19 months, providing valuable insights into patient demographics, satisfaction, and operational metrics.

## Key Features
1. Interactive Visualizations:

- Monthly View: Displays the number of patients, average wait time, satisfaction scores, and department referrals for each month.
- Consolidated View: Provides a high-level summary of overall trends and patterns.
- Patient Details: Explores detailed patient data, including age group, gender, and admission status.
- Key Takeaways: Summarizes key insights from the analysis.

2. KPIs and Metrics:

- Average Wait Time: 36.3 minutes (indicating room for improvement).
- Satisfaction Score: 4.96 out of 5 (shows positive feedback).
- Department Referrals: Highlights the most referred departments (e.g., General Practice, Orthopedics).

3. Demographic and Behavioral Insights:

- Patient demographics segmented by age, gender, and race.
- Analysis of peak busy hours and days for resource optimization.
  
4. Custom Visualizations:

- Heatmaps to display patient counts by hour and day.
- Bar and donut charts for demographic breakdowns.
- Line graphs to track monthly trends.

## Technologies Used
- Power BI Desktop: For data modeling, visualization, and report creation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to calculate KPIs and dynamic measures.
- Custom Date Table: For time intelligence and filtering.

## Key Insights
- The busiest days were Mondays, and peak hours were 11 AM, 7 PM, and 11 PM, indicating a need for better staffing during these periods.
- The average wait time (36.3 minutes) suggests moderate patient satisfaction and areas for process optimization.
